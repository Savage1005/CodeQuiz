# CodeQuiz

For this assignment , we are tasked with creating our own quiz.  I chose to make mine about Rock and Roll.  The quiz starts when you press the start button and for each wrong answer, ten seconds is taken off of the timer. There are 5 questions. Whatever time is left at the end of the game is your final score.  I used bootstrap for my styling so I didn't have a css.  This assignment was very challenging for me and I was unable to complete the high score page in the time allotted.
